#### a python spellchecker

The main file in this program, [spellchecker.py](https://github.com/khennes/spellchecker/blob/master/spellchecker.py), takes a single word from the user as input and searches for it inside a large list of English words using binary search. If the word is not found in the list, the program generates a list of permutations by removing duplicate letters and swapping out vowels, then returns the closest valid match to the user. To help the program return the best match, in the case that many valid suggestions are generated, I scraped a [Wiktionary page](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Wiktionary:Frequency_lists/PG/2006/04/1-10000) listing the top 10,000 most common words in English using Beautiful Soup ([frequencies.py](https://github.com/khennes/spellchecker/blob/master/frequencies.py), loaded the list into a JSON file, [wordlist.json](https://github.com/khennes/spellchecker/blob/master/wordlist.json), then wrote a function to compare the program's suggested words against the wordlist and return a more commonly-used word to the user over a less common one. 


To test the program, I wrote a suite of [Nose tests](https://github.com/khennes/spellchecker/blob/master/nose_tests.py) as well as a second program, [misspellings.py](https://github.com/khennes/spellchecker/blob/master/misspellings.py), which performs the reverse: it takes a valid English word as input from the user, mangles it by adding duplicate letters and replacing the vowels, then pipes it into the spellchecker to ensure that the spellchecker always returns a valid word in response.
